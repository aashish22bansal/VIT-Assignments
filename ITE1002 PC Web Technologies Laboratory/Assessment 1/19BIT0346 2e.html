		<h4>Print a paragraph with 4 - 5 sentences. Each sentence should be a different font</h4>
		<p style="font-family:'Calibri'">Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Arial Rounded MT Bold'">Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Castellar'">Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Tahoma'">But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesnâ€™t guarantee unity.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence.</p>
