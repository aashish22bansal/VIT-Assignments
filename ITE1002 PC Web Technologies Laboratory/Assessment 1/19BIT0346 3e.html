            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be 
            displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets 
            (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web 
            server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes 
            the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the 
            document.
