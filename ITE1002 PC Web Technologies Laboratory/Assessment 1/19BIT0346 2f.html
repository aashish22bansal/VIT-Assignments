		<p><i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, fantasy novel by <i>J.R.R. Tolkien</i> initially published in <i>three</i> parts as <i>The Fellowship of the Ring (1954)</i>, 
		<i>The Two Towers (1955)</i>, and <i>The Return of the King (1955)</i>. The novel, set in the <i>Third Age</i> of Middle Earth, formed a sequel to Tolkien’s 
		<i>The Hobbit (1937)</i> and was succeeded by his posthumous <i>The Silmarillion (1977)</i>. The Lord of the Rings is the saga of a group of sometimes 
		reluctant heroes who set forth to save their world from <i>consummate</i> evil. Its many worlds and creatures were drawn from Tolkien’s extensive
		knowledge of philology and folklore.</p>
